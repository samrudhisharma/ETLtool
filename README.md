ETLtool
=======

This repository contains the java code of the data mining algorithms implemented as a part of my Extract Transform and Load project.

As a part of my third year project I developed an ETL tool for a Data Warehouse consisting of medicine and pharmaceutical data corpus.

The tool was designed to extract data from various sources such as Access, Excel, MySQL Server, SQLite and Text Files, and then apply various transformations and finally load the data in the data warehouse.

Applied various data mining algorithms for data classification, clustering and association rules on Data Warehouse.
The algorithms applied were: 
1)	Kmeans
2)	Naive Bayes
3)	KNN
4)	Agglomerative Heirarchical Clustering
