ETLtool
=======

This repository contains the Java programs of the data mining algorithms implemented as a part of the Extract Transform and Load project.It is developed as a part of the Data Warehouse and Mining course (DWM). It consists of a pharmaceutical data corpus.

The tool was designed to extract data from various sources such as Access, Excel, MySQL and Text Files, and then apply various transformations and finally load the data in the data warehouse.

Applied various data mining algorithms for data classification, clustering and association rules on Data Warehouse.

The algorithms applied are: 

1)	Kmeans

2)	Naive Bayes

3)	KNN

4)	Agglomerative Heirarchical Clustering

Frontend: JFrame

Backend: Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, MySQL, Text Files
